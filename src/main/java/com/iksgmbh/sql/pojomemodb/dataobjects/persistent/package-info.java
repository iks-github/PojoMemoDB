/**
 * All classes for storing domain data for persistence are located in this package,
 * e.g. table metadata, columns and content data.
 * Note that for a MemoryDB all data is somehow temporal,
 * but the persistence domain objects are meant to be potentially persistent
 * and could be serialised and saved on hard disc if really needed.
