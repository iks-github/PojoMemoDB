#The SQL Pojo Memory Database   

* * *

Have you ever felt the need to mock a database in your unit tests? 
Have you ever set up a memory db without cursing? 
Have you ever run into problems with maven and its repositories for resolving a long list of required dependencies?

The little jar here is a fake db implemented to be used most easily in unit tests that contain database accesses.

It's based only on plain Java and only needs joda-time, commons-lang3 and commons-collection to compile and run.

You need only one short command to have a connection.

Supports a number of the most common SQL operation (create, insert and select).

It is really fast in execution.
